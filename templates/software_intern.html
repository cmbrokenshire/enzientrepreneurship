                <p>Enzi is an E-mobility company using the latest e-mobility technology  to reinvent the operations of the Kenyan commercial motorcycle industry known as the boda industry. Our team  makes electric motorcycles and battery swap stations which remove highly polluting motorcycles off the road and increase the take home pay of the drivers. Here at Enzi are revolutionising one of the largest economic drivers in Sub Saharan Africa,  pushing technological boundaries to efficiently deliver a great product  at a massive scale with aims of lifting a large segment of the population above the poverty line. The company is growing at an alarming rate, having raised over 1 million dollars, and now more than ever there is a drive to create a plan for the future. At Enzi we know, the better our blueprint, the more lives we can change. </p>
