                <h2>UX/UI Design Specialist - App Development  Internship - (8 weeks)</h2>
                <p> Begins March 18th </p>
                <p>Enzi is an E-mobility company using the latest e-mobility technology  to reinvent the operations of the Kenyan commercial motorcycle industry known as the boda industry. Our team  makes electric motorcycles and battery swap stations which remove highly polluting motorcycles off the road and increase the take home pay of the drivers. Here at Enzi are revolutionising one of the largest economic drivers in Sub Saharan Africa,  pushing technological boundaries to efficiently deliver a great product  at a massive scale with aims of lifting a large segment of the population above the poverty line. The company is growing at an alarming rate, having raised over 1 million dollars, and now more than ever there is a drive to create a plan for the future. At Enzi we know, the better our blueprint, the more lives we can change. </p>
                <p>It’s no secret that we want to change the world. In order to do that we first must onboard and develop the best people, starting with university students. </p>

As a UX/UI design at Enzi, interns will help research, brainstorm and prototype the UI for Enzi’s boda software that has the potential of being used by thousands of drivers in the Nairobi area.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 2024, Enzi will be hosting a small number of unpaid UX/UI design internships. Applicants are encouraged to express their interest in one or more internships provided by Enzi. </p>

Our UI/UX design interns will work directly with our Lead Software developer to build and deploy Enzi's first app! Enzi is a unique place to work and we live by our values, so it's worth learning more about us.</p>
                <p>Internships are unpaid and are a minimum of 8 weeks. All spring  internships will begin March 18th and will go until May 20th.
