                <h2> Machine Learning Spring Research Associate - Infrastructure Optimization Internship - (8 weeks) </h2>
                <p> Begins March 18th </p>
                <p>Enzi is an E-mobility company using the latest e-mobility technology  to reinvent the operations of the Kenyan commercial motorcycle industry known as the boda industry. Our team  makes electric motorcycles and battery swap stations which remove highly polluting motorcycles off the road and increase the take home pay of the drivers. Here at Enzi are revolutionising one of the largest economic drivers in Sub Saharan Africa,  pushing technological boundaries to efficiently deliver a great product  at a massive scale with aims of lifting a large segment of the population above the poverty line. The company is growing at an alarming rate, having raised over 1 million dollars, and now more than ever there is a drive to create a plan for the future. At Enzi we know, the better our blueprint, the more lives we can change. </p>
                <p>Itâ€™s no secret that we want to change the world. In order to do that we first must onboard and develop the best people, starting with university students. </p>
                <p>If you have a passion for solving challenging problems; learning how to build scalable, robust systems; love working with the latest technologies in a fast-paced, flexible environment; and are excited at the prospect of having a significant impact on software that could change millions of lives, then we want to talk to you.</p>
                <p>Machine Learning Research at Enzi improves various aspects of our business but our interns will mainly focus on infrastructure planning and optimization. A core element of the business are the swap stations (where the batteries are swapped for new ones) and the charging stations (where the batteries are charged in bulk). As a Machine Learning Spring Research Associate interns will be using data gathered from our drivers to find the optimal location to place swap and charge stations within Nairobi.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 2024, Enzi will be hosting a small number of unpaid Machine Learning Research internships. Applicants are encouraged to express their interest in one or more internships provided by Enzi. </p>
                <p>We are looking for individuals with the following qualifications:</p>
                <h3>Must have:</h3>

                <p>The Spring Internship:</p>
                <p>At Enzi we offer a personalised experience for interns, and our aim is to offer an experience that mimics what it is like to actually work here. We match qualified interns with projects and groups based on interests and skill sets, and fully embed interns within those groups for the Spring. Each intern will be assigned a mentor that will work with them to develop their skills, advise them on their work, and accommodate their needs.  Our Machine Learning Research Associates will work directly with our Program director to build and present statistical findings to the team! Enzi is a unique place to work and we live by our values, so it's worth learning more about us.</p>
                <p>Internships are unpaid and are a minimum of 8 weeks. All spring  internships will begin March 18th and will go until May 20th. Upon completion of the internship, students will receive a certificate of completion and a letter of recommendation based on their growth and contribution during their time at Enzi. Additionally, the internships are also eligible for University Credit. </p>
                <p>Thank you for your interest in exploring career opportunities with our team. We are committed to attracting and nurturing exceptional talent and appreciate your consideration of our organisation for your professional journey.</p>
